## HOW TO MAKE GOOD

- Option to active wrecking ball mode:
  
  - Ball smashes through bricks w/o bouncing
  
  - Ball goes super fast
  
  - Activating mode incurs movement restrictin on paddle
  
  - can only activate once per bounce on paddle

- BONUS: Paddle durability as special effect during certain levels?
